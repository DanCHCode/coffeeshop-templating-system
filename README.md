# Coffee Shop Website Templating System
The code and templates used to generate the website of the fictional [Coffee Stop Station](https://danchcode.github.io/coffeeshop/) coffee shop.

Uses Jinja and Python Frontmatter to quickly translate markdown files into HTML files using templates, updating page elements across the entire website each time the program runs.

Because the code was built quickly and experimentally and for this very specific use case, it is provided for demonstrational purposes only and should ideally not be used as a foundation for any other projects.
